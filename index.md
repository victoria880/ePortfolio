## **Professional Self-Assessment**

Greetings! My name is Victoria Franklin, and I am a passionate computer science student at SNHU. In October 2018, I embarked on a journey to earn my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, and I am thrilled to share my progress with you through this GitHub account. Here, I will showcase my work for CS-499 and other projects contributing to my academic journey. During my pursuit of a BS in computer science from Southern New Hampshire University with a software engineering concentration, I have acquired a diverse set of skills. These include proficiency in various programming languages, an understanding of computer hardware and software, and familiarity with the different phases of the software development life cycle. I have demonstrated my expertise in database management with SQL and MongoDB and my understanding of programming languages like C++, Python, and Java. This comprehensive program has equipped me to excel in a career in software engineering.

## **Milestone One: Code Review**

For the first milestone, I recorded a detailed review of my code for each artifact. The review covers my approach to improving the code by identifying constraints, flaws, and vulnerabilities. It provides insights into each artifact's features and my proposed improvements.

**Key Highlights:**
- Identified and addressed critical issues in the code.
- Proposed enhancements for better performance and reliability.
- Discussed the impact of improvements on overall code quality.

## **Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

One of my most impactful projects was the thermostat control board model, `gpiointerrupt.c`, developed for the final project in CS-350. This project involved integrating a timer, GPIO interrupt, UART, an I2C sensor, and temperature-based LED control, demonstrating my proficiency in embedded systems.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Refined global variable management for improved clarity and reduced scope.
- Enhanced error management and recovery in I2C and UART.
- Implemented UART_write for debugging output instead of printf for better communication with embedded systems.
- Added comprehensive comments and documentation for improved code readability.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Emphasized the importance of error management and modular architecture.
- Gained insights into hardware challenges and the need for rigorous testing.

## **Milestone Three: Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The `BufferOverflow.cpp` artifact from CS-405: Secure Coding illustrates my understanding of buffer overflow vulnerabilitiesâ€”a critical security concern. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to apply secure coding practices to address such vulnerabilities.

**Improvements Made:**
- Implemented input size checks to prevent buffer overflow.
- Enhanced user feedback and error handling mechanisms.
- Applied secure coding practices to improve code robustness.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Developed skills in identifying and resolving security issues.
- Gained experience in applying secure coding guidelines and best practices.

## **Milestone Four: Enhancement Three: Databases**

The `AnimalShelter.py` artifact from a course final assignment showcases my expertise in database management using MongoDB. This enhancement focuses on CRUD operations and improvements to code efficiency and security.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Secured database access by incorporating authentication credentials.
- Optimized CRUD operations for better performance and readability.
- Improved error handling and logging for easier maintenance.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Proficiency in MongoDB and secure database management.
- Ability to design scalable and maintainable code.
