## **Milestone One: Code Review**

As part of my first strategy, I recorded myself reviewing the code for each artifact. This code review details my strategy for improving the code by analyzing it for constraints, flaws, and vulnerabilities. These code reviews show each category's essential features as they travel through the current code and proposed improvements.

## **Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

One of the most enjoyable experiences during my studies was constructing the thermostat control board model, `gpiointerrupt.c`, for the final project in the CS-350 class. This project, which involved a timer, GPIO interrupt, UART, an I2C sensor, and temperature-based LED control, was a testament to my programming abilities. The management of GPIO pins, timers, and peripherals (`GPIO_init`, `initTimer`) demonstrated my understanding of embedded system performance and reliability. This artifact, a result of an excellent course, is now a part of my ePortfolio.

## **Milestone Three: Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The `BufferOverflow.cpp` artifact from CS 405: Secure Coding is crucial to my enhancement. It's a classic runtime error: a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program writes past an array or buffer's end, corrupting nearby memory. This artifact is important because it shows my profound grasp of such vulnerabilities commonly caused by unexpected user input.

## **Milestone Four: Enhancement Three: Databases**

I improved `AnimalShelter.py`, a course final assignment. MongoDB's `AnimalShelter` class CRUDs animals. This code initializes the MongoDB connection and implements create, read, update, and delete operations. Numerous adjustments can improve code. The `__init__` method now includes secure username and password handling, among other enhancements.
