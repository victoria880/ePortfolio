    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings! My name is Victoria Franklin, and I am a passionate computer science student at SNHU. 
        In October 2018, I embarked on a journey to earn my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, 
        and I am thrilled to share my progress with you through this GitHub account. Here, I will showcase my 
        work for CS-499 and other projects contributing to my academic journey. During my pursuit of a BS in 
        computer science from Southern New Hampshire University with a software engineering concentration, I 
        have acquired a diverse set of skills. These include proficiency in various programming languages, an 
        understanding of computer hardware and software, and familiarity with the different phases of the 
        software development life cycle. I have demonstrated my expertise in database management with SQL and 
        MongoDB and my understanding of programming languages like C++, Python, and Java. This comprehensive 
        program has equipped me to excel in a career in software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        SDLC projects like the thermostat control board model (gpiointerrupt.c) have helped me learn embedded 
        system software development and operation. I'm good at hardware interactions, code reuse, and program 
        stability. I worked on BufferOverflow.cpp in CS 405: Secure Coding to learn about security problems 
        and how to address them. Fixing buffer overflows and using secure code has enhanced my software's 
        reliability and safety. Information Models and Programs: I used AnimalShelter.py to demonstrate my 
        data operations and algorithm design skills in CS340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This project 
        showed I can handle complex data structures and apply theoretical concepts. AnimalShelter.py helped 
        students handle MongoDB NoSQL databases. This project investigated database access security, data 
        integrity, and CRUD.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the program and culminating project, I have gained valuable skills beyond technical knowledge, 
        significantly enhancing my career development. It was recommended to take a systematic approach to finding 
        and fixing complex issues for data processing, code debugging, and security vulnerabilities. I have honed my 
        project management abilities by submitting my work on time. These abilities enable me to organize, carry out, 
        and assess my tasks. Communication is vital in teamwork and business, and code reviews and detailed documentation 
        have helped me enhance this skill. The curriculum has fostered a spirit of continuous learning and technical 
        relevance through its experiences and challenges. Because of my experience in the computer science program and 
        the CS-499 Capstone project, I am more prepared for the workforce. With the information and knowledge presented 
        in this ePortfolio, I am confident in my ability to make a positive impact in the field of computer science. 
        As a software developer, I can't wait to use these skills in the real world.

    <h2>Milestone One: Code Review</h2>
    <p>
        As part of my first strategy, I recorded myself reviewing the code for each artifact. This code review details 
        my strategy for improving the code by analyzing it for constraints, flaws, and vulnerabilities. These code 
        reviews show each category's essential features as they travel through the current code and proposed improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
        This code review evaluates three artifacts: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, 
        and databases. The first artifact, <code>gpiointerrupt.c</code>, is a model for a thermostat control board written 
        in C and run in Code Composer Studio. It showcases the process of interacting with hardware components like LEDs, 
        buttons, UART, I2C, and timers. The code could use improvements such as reduced redundancy, refactored button handling, 
        consistent code formatting, enhanced error handling and logging, improved comments, unit tests, and breaking down 
        functions into smaller modules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second artifact, <code>BufferOverflow.cpp</code>, is C++ code from the CS 405: Secure Coding course. It has a buffer 
        overflow vulnerability, which can be addressed by applying <code>std::setw(20)</code> correctly, implementing error handling, 
        and implementing thorough unit tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third artifact, <code>AnimalShelter.py</code>, is a final project from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. It creates an 
        <code>AnimalShelter</code> class in MongoDB that performs CRUD actions on an animal collection. The code snippet defines the 
        <code>AnimalShelter</code> class, which includes methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. Improvements 
        include adding unit tests for CRUD operations and typing hints for better readability and maintainability.

    <h2>Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        One of the most enjoyable experiences during my studies was the construction of the thermostat control board model, 
        <code>gpiointerrupt.c</code>, for the final project in the CS-350 class. This project, which involved a timer, GPIO interrupt, 
        UART, an I2C sensor, and temperature-based LED control, was a testament to my programming abilities. The management of GPIO 
        pins, timers, and peripherals (<code>GPIO_init</code>, <code>initTimer</code>) demonstrated my understanding of embedded 
        system performance and reliability. This artifact, a result of an excellent course, is now a part of my ePortfolio. Directly 
        initializing all global variables improved and clarified the code. Enclosing global variables in functions or restricting their 
        scope to specific regions lowers their influence. Error management and recovery in I2C and UART must be reliable. They use UART 
        instead of <code>printf</code> and <code>UART_write</code> for debugging output, which aids in error detection. Regularly 
        utilizing <code>UART_write</code> instead of <code>printf</code> for debug output implies that you can communicate with embedded 
        systems and TI-RTOS. Write interrupt handlers and sensor settings with comments that clarify ambiguous logic and briefly outline 
        functions, including parameters, purpose, and return values. To implement the variable, update the button logic (<code>gpioButtonFxn0</code> 
        and <code>gpioButtonFxn1</code>) based on the current state. By testing the timing logic for application requirements, we prevented 
        delays and overlaps. All peripherals, including timers and GPIO pins, are released when idle. Changing the thing was both instructive 
        and life-changing. Software development taught me the importance of proper error management. Handling errors gracefully avoids crashes 
        and ambiguity. Incorrect sensor readings and failed I2C transactions were difficult to resolve. The fault could be in software, wiring, 
        or hardware; diagnosis necessitates a thorough approach. Detailed preparation, including understanding system needs and potential challenges, 
        was required to ensure project success. Improving the artifact demonstrated the value of modular architecture, error control, and rigorous 
        testing in software engineering. It emphasized hardware challenges, preparation, and thorough debugging.

    <h2>Milestone Three: Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>
        BufferOverflow.cpp demonstrates secure coding. This artifact fixes buffer overflows, a typical security concern that can be 
        exploited to execute arbitrary code, overwrite memory, or crash the program. This artifact demonstrates my understanding 
        of computer science algorithms and data structures, particularly secure programming, memory management, and programming 
        language understanding by using C++ code to investigate and solve the challenge. Fixing this issue necessitates safe memory 
        handling and overflow prevention. I improve program security and prevent vulnerabilities by validating and sanitizing user 
        input, setting secure defaults, and using secure functions instead of unsafe ones. During the program and artifact improvement, 
        I enhanced my debugging skills. Buffer overflows are hard to detect and correct. Artifact code-level changes and enhancements 
        show my debugging ability. I can quickly locate, analyze, and fix software vulnerabilities by improving the artifact. I improved 
        the code by carefully handling user inputs to prevent overflows, used tools like ASAN to find memory issues, and strengthened error 
        handling and testing. This protects the program against buffer overflows and other common memory-related attacks.

    <h2>Milestone Four: Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
    <p>
        The third and final artifact, the <code>AnimalShelter.py</code> project, demonstrates my MongoDB CRUD operation competence. 
        CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts uses this project. CRUD, the foundation of many modern apps, is important in my ePortfolio. 
        This artifact exemplifies my database management skills. It highlights the <code>AnimalShelter.py</code> program's database 
        interaction, which is a key component of web apps and services. Because data is valuable, my ePortfolio must contain MongoDB 
        and CRUD. This project enhanced my programming skills and database management techniques. The program highlights my programming, 
        database administration, and algorithmic abilities by supporting an animal shelter's essential database activities. 
        <code>AnimalShelter.py</code> strengthens CRUD and MongoDB skills. It exemplifies my ability to construct efficient, scalable, 
        and safe database-driven applications. It shows my capacity to design user-friendly, well-structured software that meets user needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This artifact highlights the database's importance in information management. Database management is crucial to computer science. 
        The <code>AnimalShelter.py</code> project highlights my expertise in creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. The artifact also 
        demonstrates my ability to design and use sophisticated data structures to optimize program performance and data integrity. It demonstrates 
        my competence in software development by writing code that interacts with databases and implements the CRUD cycle. The 
        <code>AnimalShelter.py</code> artifact demonstrates my capacity to design efficient algorithms, apply theoretical computer science principles, 
        and solve practical problems using a real-world project. I improved my MongoDB and CRUD expertise by improving this artifact. I refined the 
        application by improving database error handling and validation, using aggregate functions, improving query performance, and improving security 
        by properly escaping user inputs and using parameterized queries. I've improved my database management abilities by improving the artifact.
